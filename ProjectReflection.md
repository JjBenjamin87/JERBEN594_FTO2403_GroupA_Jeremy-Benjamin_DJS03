DJS03 Project Brief: Book Connect - Abstractions

Project Overview
Abstractions simplify complex systems by breaking them into smaller, more manageable parts. In my code, I use several abstractions to enhance modularity, reusability, and readability.

Features

* Search books by title, author, and genre.
* Paginate large result sets.
* Support light and dark themes.
* Display book previews with author and title.
* Show detailed book overlays with image, title, author, and description.

Project Breakdown

* Data and Constants: Importing data and constants from external modules hides their details, enhancing abstraction.
* Function Abstractions: Functions simplify complex tasks into reusable units throughout the codebase.
* DOM Element Abstraction: The 'getElement' function abstracts DOM element selection, replacing repetitive 'document.querySelector' calls.
* Data Filtering Abstraction: The 'applySearchFilters' function filters book data based on search criteria, allowing flexible filtering logic updates without modifying data usage code.
* Event Handling Abstraction: Event listeners manage user interactions like button clicks and form submissions, abstracting interaction details for easier maintenance and expansion.

These abstractions improve code structure, making it easier to modify and maintain over time.

Implementation Approach

Feature: Book Connect

User Story: As a user, I want to search for books using various filters to find books of interest.
Background: Given the Book Finder application is running.

Scenarios:

* Search for Books: Enter a search term in the bar, press enter to search, and view matching books.
* Filter by Genre: Select a genre from the dropdown, press enter to apply, and view books matching the genre.
* Filter by Author: Choose an author from the dropdown, press enter to apply, and view books by the selected author.
* View Book Details: Click on a book preview to see detailed information.
* Load More Results: Click "Show more" to display additional books.
* Change Theme: Access settings, choose a theme from the dropdown, and switch to the selected theme.
* Close Overlays: Click cancel in overlays to close the search, settings, or active book overlay.
* These refinements enhance clarity and simplify interactions in the application.
